# Simple boilerplate for a landing page using 11ty

Not so many people have experience using 11ty. This is a very up to date package that you can check it out how it works. Feel free to reach me at https:://brunobarros.dev

## Getting Started

### 1. Clone this Repository

```
git clone https://github.com/bobarros/11typroject.git

```

### 2. Navigate to the directory created

```
cd 11typroject
```

### 3. Install dependencies

```
npm install
```

### 4. Run Eleventy

```
npm run dev
```

### 5. Build for production

```
npm run build
```

### Notes

* `/webstory` has an example of amp-story.
* `development` mode for webpack is not working after updating all packages. I will be very happy if someone can give me a hand.
